Welcome to the CookieNvim; A Personal Development Environment (PDE) Neovim
configuration for HonsonCooky.

This `README.md` contains a narrative of my quest to create the ideal
development setup. It details the obstacles I faced and the strategies I
implemented to overcome them. Neovim has played a large part in this journey.

## Introduction

My development journey started in my late teens, and quickly jumped straight
into a four year Software Engineering degree. Throughout these six years, my
focus was based on educator directed learnings. Upon entering the workforce,
and with some more free time on my hands, I made the decision to fix some bad
habits that I had picked up on during my educational career.

## Correct Finger Placement

The first thing I wanted to address was my improper finger placement. The
thought process being that with correct finger placement I could reduce my risk
for RSI and increase my typing speed (capped at ~48wpm).

Utilizing the "Microsoft Sculpt" keyboard enabled me to quickly pick up this
skill, as it's ergonomic and unfamiliar design accentuated any moments where my
previous muscle memory kicked in (like using my left index finger for the "y"
key).

The result of picking up this skill was that my typing speed increased to
~80wpm, and I found that typing for an entire day (be it emails or code) was a
lot more comfortable. However, adopting this new skill created more problems.

- Pressing the `p` key with your right pinky is a nightmare for keyboards that
implement the typewriter left leaning slant. It's understandable how the slant
came to be, but this is not a comfortable (or consistently accurate) way to
type for me.

- Special Character Keys, Number Keys, Function Keys and the mouse all require my fingers to stray away from the home row. Whilst this isn't inherently a bad thing, it does interrupt my _"flow state"_. Picture this, I've got an idea and a solid grasp of the programming language I'm using. I know what I'm doing, and all I need to do is write it down. The furious clatter of my keyboard indicates to my coworkers that you should tell me about your weekend at another time. Then, a curly bracket is required for my next keystroke. Without looking, I smash my pinky into backspace. Like a car going 100km/h smashing into an immovable object, my momentum has instantly been interrupted as I attempt to decipher the unexpected turn of events. Upon fixing the error, I'm now faced with putting in the energy to accelerate back up to my previous speed. This whiplash inducing error happens incredibly often with characters out of reach from the home row. A skill issue for sure, but an unnecessary one nonetheless. A very similar problem occurs when reaching for the mouse.

## 40% Keyboard Update

With a little bit a research into solving the keyboard issue, I come across the "ZSA Planck Ez"; a 40% ortholinear keyboard. The 40% layout means that (with some custom layouts) all special characters, numbers and function keys are within reach without moving away from home row. Furthermore, the ortholinear layout ensure that I can hit the `p` key without any issues.

Now all I'm left with, is an annoying reliance on
