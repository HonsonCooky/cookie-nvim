# CookieNvim

Welcome to CookieNvim, an opinionate Neovim configuration for Windows 10/11. As a Neovim configuration, my focus is on
the following (ordered by importance):

- **_Usablilty:_** Runs with personal && work computers (no admin privileges).
- **_Replicability:_** Environment requirements are setup programmatically.
- **_Ease-Of-Use:_** Intelli-sense | Debugging | Automatic Themes | Keybindings for RSI sake.
- **_Minimalist:_** As little 'CookieNvim specific' components, as possible.

CookieNvim is a personal configuration. As such, post configuration of themes, keybindings, etc are not foudn here (see
LunarVim, NvChad, AstroNvim, or LazyVim for such environments). However, being an open-source Neovim configuration, you
can always fork/copy this configuration and make it your own ðŸ™‚.

## Default Development Environments

By default, CookieNvim is setup for the following:

- `.Net | C#`,
- `NodeJS | TypeScript | Vue.js | Next.js | Tailwindcss`,
